          <h1>Biography of Gary Blue</h1>
          <p>
            Gary Blue was a man with a passion for good food and a love for fried chicken that knew no bounds.
            Born in a rural town in Newfoundland, Gary grew up savouring his family's secret chicken batter recipes, which sparked his dream of sharing this deliciousness within his community. 
            In 1964, with determination and a heart full of enthusiasm, he opened his very own diner with the hope of starting new families traditions for many years to come.</p>
